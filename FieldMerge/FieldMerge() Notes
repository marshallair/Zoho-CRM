Current approach:

Loop for blocks, process opening of blocks for functions, then pre-load stack with function name then function arguments
For closing blocks, check for function arguments and process as directed

Order of development and testing:
  BLOCK {}
  FIELD ${} or $F${}
    just field name
    with EVAL_IF_NULL_OR_ERROR block
  AND{}
  OR{}
  && operator
  || operator
  + operator
  -- unary negative operator (can I do single - and detect somehow?)
  IIF{}
  ALL functions
  ALL operators
