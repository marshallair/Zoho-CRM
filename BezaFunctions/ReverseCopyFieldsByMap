ReverseCopyFieldsByMap() is a useful function for copying data from one module to another, as long as the field names and record IDs are known.
	It is frequently used in buttons or Workflow Rules that require need to update data in the current module.
	It returns the results of the write to the target records as a string. Frequently, a record has already been looked up in the calling function,
	so that record's contents can be passed instead of a FromID. The FromMod and FromID are therefore ignored if a FromData map is passed.
	
	Format:
	<stringvar>=
	CopyFieldsByMap(
		FromMod as String,			the Module to be copied from
		FromID as Int,				the ID of the record in the module to be copied from
		FromData as String,			a Map of the data pulled from the From record using .getRecordFromID() or another function (ignore FromMod and FromID)
		ToMod as String,			the Module to be copied to
		ToID as Int,				the ID of the record to be copied to
		FieldPairs as String		a list of field pairs, separated by commas, with each pair also separated by a comma
		)
